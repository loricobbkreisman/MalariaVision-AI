# MalariaVision-AI
A Deep Learning Computer Vision Model for Malaria Detection in Red Blood Cells

This is my capstone project from the MIT postgraduate Applied Data Science program, which I completed October 2025.

I started with a library of images of red blood cells that were or were not infected with the malaria parasite. I then developed deep learning models to automatically identify if the cells are malaria positive or negative. The goal of this project is to provide a new diagnostic opportunity for underresourced areas where malaria is endemic.
